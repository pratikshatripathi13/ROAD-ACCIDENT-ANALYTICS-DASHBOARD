🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (2023)

An end-to-end Power BI dashboard project analyzing road accident data across North America (2023) using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset.
The project focuses on identifying key factors contributing to accidents and fatalities through interactive visual analytics.

📌 Project Overview
This dashboard transforms raw public safety data into actionable insights by analyzing:

Accident patterns across vehicle types

Impact of weather and light conditions

Collision types (MAN_COLL) and harmful events

Geographic trends using latitude–longitude mapping

Accident severity using a Fatality Rate KPI

The goal is to move beyond simple counts and understand why accidents occur and what factors increase fatal risk.
