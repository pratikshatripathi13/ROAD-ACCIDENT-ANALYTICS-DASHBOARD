ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

Completed an end-to-end Power BI dashboard project analyzing road accident data (2023) across North America, with a focus on understanding what factors contribute most to accidents and fatalities.
Using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), I cleaned and transformed raw accident records and built an interactive, multi-page dashboard that highlights:

Key accident trends by vehicle type, weather conditions, light conditions, and collision type

A fatality rate KPI to move beyond counts and measure accident severity

Geographic patterns using latitude–longitude mapping to identify high-impact areas

Cause-level insights to understand why accidents occur, not just where or how many

The goal of this project was to convert complex public safety data into clear, actionable insights 
through thoughtful visualization and dashboard design, similar to how analytics is used in real-world traffic safety and policy analysis.
